# Defect-Segmentation-on-Textured-Surfaces
An Artificial Neural Network (CNN) to detect defects on textured surfaces

This project is a synthetic benchmark corpus for detect detection on statistically textured surfaces.We hope that it facilitates to further develop and benchmark classification algorithms for applications of industrial optical inspection.
